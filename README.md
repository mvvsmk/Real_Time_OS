# Real_Time_OS

### Overview

This project is my attempt to make a Real-Time OS for embedded systems. I will be using an STM32F4 Discovery Board, and the language of choice will be C. I would love to use c++ in the project, but the problem occurs while compiling; a method that comes to mind, to bypass this, you would have to write a linker script which is way too experimental. 

I also aim to have a layer of abstraction between the I/O drives of the micro-controller so that the os developed can be deployed on other ARM Cortex microcontrollers by setting up the I/O configuration for the chosen microcontroller.  

I track my progress in the logbook present in the repository and update on how things are progressing.
